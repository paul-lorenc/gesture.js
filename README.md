# gesture.js
Gesture.js is a p5 instance variable that handles user input and generatively creates art in response. The gesture creation process is turn based, with the user inputing curves to the canvas, which the algorithm then randomly chooses how to process.

Eventually I will add instances of this gesture application to my p5journal project.
