# gesture.js
Gesture.js is an p5 instance variable that handles user input and generatively creates art in response. The gesture creation process is turn based, with the user inputing curves to the canvas, the algorithm then takes these curves and randomly chooses ways to process the user input.

Eventually I will add instances of this gesture application to my p5journal project.
